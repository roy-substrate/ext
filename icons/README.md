# Icons Placeholder

This folder should contain the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, you can create simple placeholder icons or use any PNG images with the correct dimensions.

## Quick Icon Creation

You can create simple placeholder icons using any image editor, or use online tools like:
- https://favicon.io/
- https://www.canva.com/
- Or any image editor to create simple colored squares

The icons should represent the extension's purpose - perhaps a clipboard or text-related symbol.
